## ðŸ’¡**Main idea**ðŸ’¡
An automated system is necessary for an enterprise to control production processes, reduce time spent on processing documentation for production. Most of the information is stored and transmitted in the form of paper documents (contracts, production documents, etc.). The activity of the enterprise is not fully automated,
the enterprise has a fairly large amount of documentation drawn up, which slows down the work of administrative personnel.

```
The furniture factory is engaged in mass production of various wood products. The production of furniture is
carried out both to order for the partners of
the company, and for sale to retail customers. The main processes of the factory are: work with customers, work
with suppliers to ensure the main activities,
production processes, product sales. At the stage of receiving an order, a sales manager works with the client.
Initially, the conditions for the execution of
the order are agreed, in case of disagreement of the conditions, additional negotiations are held, which may end
with the agreement of the conditions of the order and the signing of the contract or the disagreement of the
conditions of the order. If the contract is signed, an order for production is formed, for which the availability
of the necessary materials in the warehouse is revealed. If necessary, an application is formed to the supplier,
on the basis of which a consignment note is issued. The conformity of the delivered materials with the consignment
note is checked. Verified materials are taken into account. If materials are available in the warehouse, they are
reserved for the order received from the client. The key process is the planning of the production program. Planning
is carried out on the basis of order analysis. A plan for the production of products by shifts is drawn up, on the
basis of the plan, tasks for production are developed. Materials are written off on the fact of spending. Furniture
production is carried out according to approved standards. At the end of the shift, the worker generates a report on
the production for the shift.
